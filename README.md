## Installation
To get this application working properly, you will need to install 3 programs. 
The first is the latest java sdk.
The second is the JavaFX program.
And the third is an IDE that can point to the JavaFX libraries which is crucial
for running the GUI

## How to Use
To use this application simply run the program and a login application will be presented. To login 
for the Driver GUI use the driver username " " and password " ". For the Admin GUI use the admin 
username " " and password " ".  The application will have different buttons depending on the user 
who is logged in.

## Configuration
For configuration, it is assumed that users are running this on a Windows PC and using the
Intellij IDE, therefore additional configuration may be needed on different setups. To get this project
configured properly use must have downloaded JavaFX. Inside the intellij IDE, right-click the
project and select "Open Module Settings". Then Select the Global Library option and click the 
plus sign to add new libraries. You then need to navigate to the JavaFX SDK folder and select the lib folder.
The path should look something like this, JavaFX --> javafx-sdk-22 --> lib. Once in 
the lib folder select all the files inside the lib folder and add it to your IDEs library.
Apply and confirm these libraries to your IDEs global libraries, and you should be able to run the program.
